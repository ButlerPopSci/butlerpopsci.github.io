<p>This past week,  Jeanny Wang, MPH, presented research from our lab  at the 17th AACR Conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved in Los Angeles, California.
<!-- excerpt end -->
Her poster showcased our ongoing research describing how  patient-provider communication may impact first course treatment received among men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the <a href="https://pcap.bioinf.unc.edu/">North Carolina Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP)</a>. The research was conducted in collaboration with folks across UNC, from PCaP, and the ButlerPopSci group. Thank you to everyone who stopped by with insightful feedback and questions!</p>

<p>Congratulations team, and look forward to seeing you all next year in Baltimore, Maryland!</p>

<p>Congratulations to Shaun R. Jones, MPH, for presenting his research this week at the <a href="https://minorityhealth.web.unc.edu/">45th Minority Health Conference</a>!</p>

<p>The Minority Health Conference is the largest and longest-running student-led health conference in the country. This year’s conference theme was ‘The Building Blocks to Well-being: Connections Between Health and Stress’, and Shaun presented his work on “Geographic and Socioeconomic Determinants of Prostate Cancer Incidence in the United States.”
At the conference, Shaun and his colleague Simon Wilson also moderated the conference’s Keynote Speaker talk given by Dr. Chantel Martin.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Shaun and team!
