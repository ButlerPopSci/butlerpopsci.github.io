<p>This past week,  Jeanny Wang, MPH, presented research from our lab  at the 17th AACR Conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved in Los Angeles, California.
<!-- excerpt end -->
Her poster showcased our ongoing research describing how  patient-provider communication may impact first course treatment received among men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the <a href="https://pcap.bioinf.unc.edu/">North Carolina Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP)</a>. The research was conducted in collaboration with folks across UNC, from PCaP, and the ButlerPopSci group. Thank you to everyone who stopped by with insightful feedback and questions!</p>

<p>Congratulations team, and look forward to seeing you all next year in Baltimore, Maryland!</p>
